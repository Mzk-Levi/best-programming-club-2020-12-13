## Assignment

Add a new section for vegetables under "Products" so that users can buy vegetables.

Try to do this programmatically.

Hint 1: Start with the HTML, using the available fruit section for reference.

Hint 2: The data for fruit is around line 32. The data for vegetables is around line 42.

Hint 3: All of the Javascript for programmatically creating the fruit section is inside `initializeProducts`.

## Getting the assignment

[Fork this repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

Make sure to commit your changes as you're making progress on the assignment. You'll receive feedback on the commit messages. Remember, commit messages should be short and sweet, in present-tense with an imperative tone. For example:

```
rename cart variable
```

Don't be afraid to commit code that's not working yet. Don't get discouraged if you can't get it to work--focus on reading the existing code and making your best guess at what the code might look like.
